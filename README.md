py_data_structures
==================

A Python 3 data structures library.

I'm pretty confident to state that this is a forever WIP project.
What do we have now:

1. (WIP) A binary tree library, containing red-black trees implementations - both Cormen's classical and Okasaki's immutable versions.  
2. (WIP) A trie implementation.
