py_data_structures
==================

A Python 3 data structures library.

I'm pretty confident to state that this is a forever WIP project.
What do we have now:

1. (WIP) A sorted set implementation using different binary search trees (dumb BST and two red-black trees versions, Cormen's classical and Okasaki's immutable).
2. (WIP) A trie implementation.
